# Multi-transclude-v1.3
- Creating a custom app container using transclude with multiple entry points.
- Inspired by [Creating Container Components, Part 2: Angular 1.3 Directives](https://www.airpair.com/angularjs/posts/creating-container-components-part-2-angular-1-directives#making-it-reusable) by Kara Erickson

## Finding elements by id 
- [angularjs Directive element.find()](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14865965/angularjs-directive-element-find)
-  If we're not using jQuery with Angular,we are relying upon Angular's jqlite implementation. We cannot do `element.find('#someid')`.
